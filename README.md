## üìä 1. Stock Analysis and Forecasting (Jupyter Notebook)

In the notebook `stock-price-prediction.ipynb`, we:

- Fetch stock data using **yFinance**
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis** (EDA) with **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**
- Analyze stock risk based on historical returns
- Build and train an **LSTM** model to predict future stock prices

**Libraries used**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `yfinance`, `keras`, `tensorflow`
